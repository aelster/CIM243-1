<h1>Seasonal Gardening Checklist </h1>
<p>&nbsp;Fall – The time to plant trees and spring-blooming bulbs. Take the time to clean the leaves and dead foliage from your beds and lawn.<br>
  &nbsp;Winter – The time to prune fruit trees and finish planting your bulbs. Don&rsquo;t forget to water young trees when the ground is dry.<br>
  &nbsp;Spring – The time to prepare your beds, plant annuals, and apply fertilizer to established plants. Remember to mulch to maintain moisture and prevent weed growth.<br>
  &nbsp;Summer – The time to supplement rainfall so that plants get one inch of water per week. Plant your vegetable garden and enjoy bountiful harvests until late fall.</p>
<h1>Basic Gardening Tips </h1>
<p>&nbsp;Select plants according to your climate. <br>
  &nbsp;In planning your garden, consider the composition, texture, structure, depth, and drainage of your soil. <br>
  &nbsp;Use compost to improve the structure of your soil. <br>
  &nbsp;Choose plant foods based on your garden objectives. <br>
  &nbsp;Generally, plants should receive one inch of water per week. <br>
  &nbsp;Use mulch to conserve moisture, keep plants cool, and cut down on weeding.</p>
