Dreamweaver Class Homework

The two folders, cc and tripsmart, are projects from the textboot and are updated every week.  I intent to tag the homework when I submit it so I can continue to work, as well as go back.

The tag command that I used is:

  git tag -a w1 -m "Week #1 Homework"

To post my latest Portfolio Project to my server I use:

  rsync -arv --delete recipes elsterne@elsternet.com:www/
